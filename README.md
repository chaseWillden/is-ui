is-ui
=====

IS-UI is another mobile-first front-end CSS framework. The sole purpose of this is literally to be another alternative, to be another solution. With night you have day. With water you have land. With rice you have beans. All are good, neither are evil, both are useful. Let this be another resource for developing the web even furthur.

Development
===========

Requirements
-------------
 - Node.js
 - Grunt

```
git clone https://github.com/chaseWillden/is=ui
```

```
grunt
```

Only edit the files in the src/ folder and grunt will build and do the rest

Releases
========
Once every 3 days will be a "patch" day where we will build IS-UI and the version number will increase
Once a week will be a "minor" day
Once a month will be a "major" day

Each command needs to be followed by:

```
grunt build
```

to build the compressed folder of the recently built IS-UI release

To do this run the command

Patch: ```grunt patch```

Minor: ```grunt minor```

Major: ```grunt major```
